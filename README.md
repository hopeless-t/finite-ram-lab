# Finite RAM Lab

A small, reproducible systems research lab for understanding how finite physical RAM aligns with actual application memory demand.

> **Core question:**  
> When physical RAM is limited, what should remain in memory, what should be reclaimed, and when?

## Status

**Systems research / experimental software — early development**

Current principle:

> **Observation before coordination.**

The project currently uses GitHub-hosted Linux runners as its primary experimental substrate. It begins by characterizing what can actually be observed there before making memory-management claims.

Current evidence:

- **ENV-001 — PASS:** hosted-runner memory telemetry is observable;
- **ENV-002 — PASS:** isolated cgroup memory budgets are enforceable;
- **OBS-001 — PASS:** application phases and OS memory state can be captured on one monotonic timeline;
- **MC-001 — 16,000 trials:** seeded synthetic replacement study completed successfully.

**Next research stage:** CHAR-001 — characterize which pressure transitions are causal, repeatable bottlenecks rather than coincident symptoms.

No new memory-management policy or coordination mechanism is authorized by the current evidence.

## Why this project exists

Applications and operating systems observe different parts of the memory problem.

Applications can know the meaning, lifecycle, rebuild cost, phase, and near-future importance of their own data.

The operating system can observe global physical-memory pressure, competition between processes, residency, reclaim activity, faults, refaults, swap behavior, and system-wide resource constraints.

Finite RAM Lab asks whether a measurable gap exists between:

```text
actual application demand
          ↕
OS-estimated demand
          ↕
physical-memory residency
```

and whether closing any observed gap can move the practical memory limit without unacceptable performance loss.

The project does **not** assume that existing Linux memory management is inefficient.

    A["Application side<br/>demand / phase / intent"] --> AT["Application telemetry"]
    K["OS / Kernel side<br/>supply / pressure / reclaim"] --> KT["OS telemetry"]

    AT --> O["Memory Observation Plane"]
    KT --> O

    O --> T["Synchronized timeline"]
    T --> C["Bottleneck characterization"]
    C --> D{"Reproducible gap?"}

    D -->|"No"| N["Record negative result"]
    D -->|"Yes"| H["Mechanism-specific hypothesis"]
    H --> E["Controlled intervention"]
    E --> V["Comparison / validation"]
```

Observation is intentionally separated from intervention.

A future mechanism may be an application hint library, a userspace coordination agent, a hybrid design, a minimal kernel extension, or no new mechanism at all.

The implementation is an experimental result, not a premise.

## Evidence rules

- observation is not explanation;
- correlation is not causation;
- a refault is not automatically a bad eviction;
- high memory utilization is not automatically inefficient;
- free memory is not itself an optimization objective;
- a successful program execution is not automatically a successful experiment;
- a benchmark improvement is not sufficient evidence of a general memory-management improvement;
- GitHub-hosted measurements describe the declared hosted environment, not arbitrary bare-metal PCs.

Canonical evidence must be structured and carry provenance.

Plots and rendered diagrams are explanatory artifacts unless an experiment contract explicitly says otherwise.

> **Observe before optimizing.**

And, for future architecture:

> **Do not choose the control plane before measuring the coordination gap.**
